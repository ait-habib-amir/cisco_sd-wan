# SD-WAN Cisco Automation Project

Automated deployment of a complete Cisco SD-WAN lab (vEdge, vSmart, vBond, vManage) using QEMU/KVM and Shell scripting.  
This project was developed as part of my Master 2 in Networks & Security at Sorbonne UniversitÃ© to simulate and automate SD-WAN infrastructures for learning and experimentation.

## Overview

This repository provides an automated and reproducible SD-WAN lab environment using Cisco virtual appliances and Linux network interfaces.  
The setup allows for:
- Virtualized SD-WAN components (vEdge, vSmart, vBond, vManage)
- Automated launch and configuration through Bash scripts
- Network interconnection via TAP and bridge interfaces
- Performance and connectivity testing with iperf
- Monitoring through Cisco vManage GUI

## Features

- Full virtual SD-WAN setup (vEdge, vBond, vSmart, vManage)
- Automated launch of all components using a single Shell script
- Dynamic network configuration (bridges, TAP interfaces)
- Integrated monitoring via vManage
- Traffic performance testing with iperf
- Compatible with QEMU/KVM and AlmaLinux
